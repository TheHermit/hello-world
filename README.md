# hello-world
This Tutorial is a great way for a Newbie to learn how to create and maintain code on GitHub. It's interactive, Easy to follow and I think Simple to do.
I am always interested in learning, especially new ways of doing things. So far, this Tutorial is helping me understand better what GitHub is all about. Although I have downloaded many files from here in the past, I was always unsure what the terms Repository, Commits and Pull Requests used here were all about.
